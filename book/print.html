<p>This guide is unofficial, to be accompanied with the guide <a href="https://gist.github.com/VideoCarp/eeaf915a2361d93f0fd8cf2c72d6db64">here</a>.<br />
Firstly, since you're new I recommend <strong>reading to full</strong>.<br />
I know that this is quite long, but I mean it's useful, and it can be accompanied with my other guide. You can contact me <a href="https://discord.gg/4stpKau">here</a></p>
<h3 id="what-are-commands"><a class="header" href="#what-are-commands">What are commands?</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>Commands are bits of text that the game Minecraft understands, they can get quite advanced, but they're <strong>easy</strong> to pick up and learn.</p>
<h3 id="why-commands"><a class="header" href="#why-commands">Why commands?</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>Commands are pretty much the only way to create Minecraft content, without a real coding language, and they're pretty cool.</p>
<h3 id="beginning"><a class="header" href="#beginning">Beginning</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>Firstly I'm going to cover some logic, this is probably the <strong>most important</strong> part.<br />
There's a lot to cover, but I'm mostly going to be covering the beginner's basics.<br />
In Minecraft, there are 2 types of things, as I like to think of them. Those 2 things are entities and blocks.<br />
You might've heard of those a lot, and they're very important.</p>
<p><strong>How to Read This</strong> This is kinda written weird, don't skip over any headers, unless you have full certainty of them.</p>
<h2 id="basics"><a class="header" href="#basics">Basics</a></h2>
<hr />
<p>Here are some of the basics, read above for a bit of how to read this.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-block"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-block">What is a block?</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>A block is essentially an object that takes up a 1x1 space . An example of a block would be say grass, dirt, etc.<br />
Everything in the below image is a block, don't worry about the water just yet.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/TqZjJ4m/FBB40-ECF-D2-F9-476-D-B56-B-1-EAA3-C6-D5-E08.png" alt="an environment in Minecraft" /></p>
<h3 id="what-is-an-entity"><a class="header" href="#what-is-an-entity">What is an entity?</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>An entity as I like to think of it is any object that is not fixed to it's position, and can take damage.<br />
Water isn't fixed to it's position, is it an entity? No, the reason for that is because water cannot take damage.<br />
<strong>All mobs, but not only mobs</strong> are entities. Below is an example of an entity.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/DGbPNgQ/Webp-net-resizeimage.png" alt="chicken.png" /></p>
<p>Now that you know what entities and blocks are, that's a step forward.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-syntax"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-syntax">What is a syntax?</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>A quick explanation I'll give about syntaxes is that they're the format of the command, if your command doesn't<br />
execute, then there's a chance it's that. Give all syntax errors a full read, if they don't work, take reference<br />
from either my main guide or the <code>/help &lt;command-name&gt;</code> command while in game.<br />
An example of a syntax error is: <code>/kill @ e</code>. That specific one will be raised because there is a space between the<br />
<code>@</code> and the <code>e</code>. We'll go deeper into these <code>@</code> things in a bit. Below is an example of a syntax error.<br />
This most likely happened because the person didn't put an argument afterwards, but don't worry too much.<br />
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/y590bt1/D20-D2-B44-1-A2-E-4-DF9-BB91-9238320-F5-A4-C.jpg" alt="error example" /></p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-read-a-syntax"><a class="header" href="#how-do-i-read-a-syntax">How do I read a syntax?</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>Here's a quick sumnary, it isn't really accurate (I personally don't read them and somehow know it):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;text_here&gt;</code>. These brackets mean that this argument is <strong>required</strong>.</li>
<li><code>[text_here]</code>. These brackets mean that this argument is <strong>optional</strong>.</li>
<li><code>(option1 | option2)</code>. These brackets mean that this argument <strong>must be one in the list</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="coordinate-management"><a class="header" href="#coordinate-management">Coordinate Management</a></h2>
<hr />
<p>This is a crucial part in commands.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-coordinates"><a class="header" href="#what-are-coordinates">What are coordinates?</a></h2>
<hr />
<p>To put it in my way, coordinates are really just the location of an object. But how do you know the coordinates?<br />
How are coordinates formatted? Well, regarding both of them, there are three <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/axis">axes</a>, namely X, Y, and Z.<br />
<strong>How are they formatted?</strong><br />
The X and Y axes should be clear, otherwise click on the hyperlink.<br />
Things start on the Z axis , that's what different, it's kind of like X, think of it as just another X, the reason<br />
for the existence of the Z axis is because the game is in 3D, don't worry too much about it for now.<br />
<strong>How does one get the coordinates of an object?</strong><br />
It's quite simple to do this, you <strong>do not need to teleport</strong> yourself. You can simply run this command:<br />
<code>/gamerule showcoordinates true</code> and your coordinates should show <strong>at the top left</strong>. Once they're showing, read the numbers after<br />
<code>Position</code>. It should look somewhat like this: <code>Position: X, Y, Z</code>. If it doesn't show exactly like that, don't panic.<br />
X, Y, and Z are used to represent the number, whatever it is , is where your legs are . We'll be getting into<br />
tildes on the next section, they will be necessary.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-tildes"><a class="header" href="#what-are-tildes">What are Tildes?</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>Tildes are the <code>~</code> character, which in English means <strong>about</strong>, <strong>near</strong>, or <strong>here</strong>.<br />
Same thing goes for coordinates in Minecraft.<br />
Each tilde in a command represents from where the command is being executed, and Math can be done on those.<br />
To add to the coordinate: <code>~&lt;number&gt;</code>. This goes for all X, Y, and Z axes.<br />
To remove from the coordinate: <code>~-&lt;number&gt;</code>. Note the <code>-</code>. This goes for all axes.</p>
<p>Say you want the player to teleport 10 blocks upwards, remember the Y axis is vertical.<br />
<code>tp &lt;target&gt; ~ ~10 ~</code>.<br />
Now what is <code>target</code> you may ask. Target means the entity the command is being executed on.<br />
This command moves the player 10 blocks up from the command block if there is one, or the person who executed it.<br />
Don't worry yet about making the player do it, we'll cover it now.</p>
<h2 id="entity-management"><a class="header" href="#entity-management">Entity Management</a></h2>
<hr />
<p>Well this is a bad name for the section, but this section is for managing entities.<br />
There are a lot of commands that can affect entities, but here I'll cover the crucial ones.</p>
<h3 id="deleting-an-entity"><a class="header" href="#deleting-an-entity">Deleting an Entity</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>It's very easy to delete an entity, you can simply use the kill command to delete an entity.<br />
But what if you wanted to delete a dropped item, or perhaps a specific mob? Below is more info.</p>
<h3 id="targetting"><a class="header" href="#targetting">Targetting</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>You can use the target selector argument, which I will be specifying information about right here.<br />
You can use the <code>@e</code> targetting, but further than that is what we'll be focusing on.<br />
<strong>@ Target Selectors</strong><br />
Now what are these? Well, I like to explain these as the main argument in selecting which entity to use.<br />
A list of each one of them, and what they do is below:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>@p</code> This selects the nearest player from where the command was executed.</li>
<li><code>@r</code> This selects a random player in the world who is online.</li>
<li><code>@s</code> This selects the <strong>entity</strong> that executed the command.</li>
<li><code>@a</code> This selects all the players.</li>
<li><code>@e</code> This selects all entites. <code>@s</code> is one I just wanna talk a bit more about. It makes the entity that executed be executed on.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, I want a creeper to say <code>Aww man</code> in the chat, I'd use:<br />
<code>execute @e[type=creeper,name=&quot;creep.er&quot;] ~ ~ ~ say Aww man</code>.<br />
You see those things in the <code>[]</code> brackets? They will be covered next.</p>
<p><code>@e[type=&lt;entity_type&gt;</code> will select a specific type of entity, this could be TNT, a dropped item, a<br />
specific mob type, etc, it can find any entity type. But what if you wanted a specific entity?<br />
<code>@e[type=&lt;entity_type&gt;,name=&lt;name&gt;</code>. With that, you'll find one of a name.<br />
A very common issue I find others doing is when they're getting the name, they usually<br />
forget to add quotes after the <code>=</code> sign. If the mob has a space in the name, simply<br />
instead of <code>&lt;name&gt;</code>, imagine it becomes <code>&quot;&lt;name&gt;&quot;</code>.<br />
The name may be ugly, and so here is an alternative, this is also a way to group entities. <code>/tag &lt;target&gt; (add | remove) &lt;name: string&gt;</code>.<br />
This will add a new group to the targetted entity, after adding it you can remove the name, if there is one.<br />
Now <code>string</code> means to add quotes, just like the name in the target selector.<br />
You may want to check for the range, here's how: <code>@e[r=&lt;range number&gt;]</code><br />
In most guides, <code>number</code> will be represented as <code>int</code> or <code>integer</code>. They both mean a number.<br />
In the case of a decimal, it's considered <code>float</code>.</p>
<h2 id="execute"><a class="header" href="#execute">Execute</a></h2>
<hr />
<p><strong>This is an extremely important section!</strong> This section is fully dedicated to making entities execute a command, think of it as <code>sudo</code>, but for commands.<br />
The execute command is the <strong>most powerful</strong> command in the entire game, but don't worry, it isn't hard to<br />
pick up on. <code>/execute &lt;target&gt; &lt;location&gt; &lt;selected command syntax&gt;</code> is the syntax.<br />
The location argument will be discussed a bit below.<br />
<code>&lt;selected command syntax&gt;</code> refers to the command you're getting the entity to execute. I always have my location as <code>~ ~ ~</code> and when it's<br />
like that, it executes anywhere, that's at least what I use for myself.<br />
But what if you wanted to check if someone was on a specific block type?<br />
<code>/execute &lt;target&gt; &lt;location&gt; detect &lt;block to detect&gt; &lt;data value&gt; &lt;detectPos&gt; &lt;command&gt;</code>.<br />
That would be your syntax.<br />
<code>detect</code> isn't in brackets, this means to just put it there, regardless.<br />
Say you wanted a creeper walking on grass to kill nearby ocelots, you'd use this: <code>/execute @e[type=creeper] ~ ~ ~ detect grass 0 ~ ~-1 ~ kill @e[type=ocelot,r=5]</code></p>

Syntax:<br>
<br>
<code>/clear &lt;target&gt; &lt;item name&gt; &lt;data: integer&gt; &lt;maxCount&gt;</code>
<br>
The data interval makes sure that the item matches the data interval, or the command will fail, this will not a trigger a<br>
conditional command block.<br>
To test for an item in a player’s inventory, use the following syntax:<br>
<br>
<code>/clear &lt;target&gt; &lt;item name&gt; &lt;data&gt; 0</code><br>
<br>
The 0 will replace the command instead of deleting an item from a player’s inventory, it will check for one.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<h2 id="give"><a class="header" href="#give">Give<br></a></h2>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000">The give command allows users to obtain items normally unobtainable, or items that already<br> are through commands.</span><br>

The raw json message field is to be filled with something like this
<code>{“rawtext”:[{“text”:”your text”}]}</code></p>
<h2 id="title"><a class="header" href="#title">Title</a></h2>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000">The title command shows text onto the middle of the player’s screen, their action bar or under it as a subtitle.</span>

<h2 id="particle"><a class="header" href="#particle">Particle</a></h2>
<p>Particle is an extremely useful and decorative command in Minecraft. It just adds cool particles and overall<br>
adds character. The syntax for it is:<br>
<code>/particle &lt;effect&gt; &lt;location&gt;</code>.<br>
But what if you wanted to use the location as a target entity? You can use the execute command for that.<br>
You can see a list of effects you can use <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Particles#Types_of_particles">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="scoreboard"><a class="header" href="#scoreboard">Scoreboard</a></h2>
<p>Scoreboard is an interesting command. It's also a very confusing one. Scoreboard is used to store the score of<br>
players in Minecraft, or maybe even entities if that's possible.<br>
To add an objective, use:<br>
<code>/scoreboard objectives add &lt;objective: string&gt; dummy [displayName: string]</code><br>
and to change the value of an objective, use:<br>
<code>scoreboard players &lt;set|add|remove&gt; &lt;player: target&gt; &lt;objective: string&gt; &lt;count: int&gt;</code>.<br>
There are a lot of things, but those are the most basic.<br>
See <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Commands/scoreboard#Syntax">gamepedia</a> for more information.</p>
<h1 id="non-commands"><a class="header" href="#non-commands">Non-Commands</a></h1>
<h2 id="conditional"><a class="header" href="#conditional">Conditional</a></h2>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000">Conditional command blocks are command blocks usually used in chains are command blocks that<br>
only work if the condition is met.<br>
These can be used in chains for shop systems and such.</span><br>
Scroll down in <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Command_Block#Modification">official gamepedia</a> a little bit<br>
until the Condition headline.</p>
<h2 id="manifest"><a class="header" href="#manifest">Manifest</a></h2>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000">The manifest is a key file in all resource packs, worlds, behavior packs, etc. The manifest is what allows the pack to show on the list.</span>

<h2 id="functions"><a class="header" href="#functions">Functions</a></h2>
<p>Functions are a way to kinda import a ton of commands into new worlds easily, unlike command blocks however, they cannot be conditional.<br>
When you run the <code>function</code> command, it executes the .mcfunction file named by your argument.<br>
<br>
For example, a file named <code>cool_file.mcfunction</code> will execute if you return the argument as <code>cool_file</code> in other words,<br>
<code>/function cool_file</code> , however, if a different argument is written, the game will search for the .mcfunction named by<br> that, if none, the command will fail.<br>
<br>
.mcfunction files are always filled with nothing but commands.<br>
<br>
Now for the folder setup.<br>
<br>
Bedrock Edition:
<span style="color: #ff0000"></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>(your pack name)</code>:open_file_folder:<br></p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>(functions)</code>:open_file_folder:, <code>&lt;manifest.json&gt;</code>📄 , <code>&lt;pack_icon.png&gt;</code>📄<br></p>

<p><strong>How to Read Guide:</strong><br>
<strong>1.</strong> Syntax<br>
This means the format the command is used in.<br>
<strong>2.</strong> Manifest<br>
This is the file in which you’ll have for things such as texture packs or bedrock edition addons.<br>
<strong>3.</strong> &lt;&gt; bracketing in syntax<br>
This means that this part of the command is required for the specified use.<br>
<strong>4.</strong> () bracketing in syntax<br>
Separated by |, this means that this part of the syntax must be one of the things within the brackets.<br>
<strong>5.</strong> [] bracketing in syntax<br>
This means that the part of the syntax is optional.<br>
<strong>6.</strong> Target<br>
This is the entity the command is being executed on.<br>
<strong>7.</strong> Entity<br>
An entity is a mob, a player, a dropped item, an armor stand, falling gravel/sand or anything in the game<br>
that isn’t in a completely solid state and fixed to it’s location.<br>
This may not be the best explanation for an entity, but you get the point.<br>
<strong>8.</strong> File Bracketing<br>
I use this to define a folder. Eg: <code>&lt;file&gt;, (folder)</code><br>
In some cases I may also have an icon. &quot;:page_facing_up:&quot; means file, :open_file_folder: means folder.<br>
<strong>9.</strong> Integer
Normal integers are really just digits. In this case, integers are numbers still, but must be valid data values.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="lexing-for-beginners"><a class="header" href="#lexing-for-beginners">Lexing for beginners</a></h1>
<p><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/reading%20time-9%20min%2C%203%20sec-yellowgreen" alt="readtime" /></p>
<p>This is a guide that should teach you how to perform basic lexing in a functional programing language.
Everything was written in Elixir, but you should be able to follow it if you are using any functional programming language.
Or even an imperative programming language like Python, C or Java.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-lexing"><a class="header" href="#what-is-lexing">What is lexing?</a></h2>
<p>The first question you should ask yourself is, what is lexing? It's the same as tokenising, scanning or lexical analysis.
That might not help you if you haven't heard of these either. <strong>Put simply, lexing is the process of breaking down a string
into meaningful units, indepdendent of context.</strong> What a lexer will do is make the following happen:</p>
<pre><code class="language-elixir"># Turn this:
# out(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
# into this
[
    {&quot;out&quot;, :identifier},
    {&quot;(&quot;, :oparen},
    {&quot;Hello World!&quot;, :string},
    {&quot;)&quot;, :cparen}
]
</code></pre>
<p>To further help you understand what lexing really is, take a look at this diagram.
<strong>Don't worry if you don't understand the terms used.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66365570/162650135-d2e0abf1-a6fc-4a02-b92b-1a7ee10354e3.png" alt="702430A0-1D90-419F-B615-455199B20EAC" /></p>
<p>If you still don't understand lexing, think of it in this way: you have a sentence in English.
It's &quot;Lexing is not easy, but it's possible.&quot;
You can break this sentence down into its words, &quot;lexing&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;not&quot;, &quot;easy&quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;but&quot;, &quot;it&quot;, &quot;'s&quot;, &quot;possible&quot;.
And then you can categorise each word. Like adjectives, verbs, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lexing can be done on any language, from English to C.</li>
<li>Lexers don't care about most errors, and they can only handle a few.</li>
<li>When developing a programming language, lexical analysis is the first step taken.</li>
<li>Lexing allows graphemes (characters) to be morphed into morphemes (small units of meaning).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-lex"><a class="header" href="#why-lex">Why lex?</a></h2>
<p>Why would you ever need to break down a string into meaningful units? And why do this process when I can just use
regex with <code>split</code> functions?
The answer to that question depends on what you're trying to do, and why. Generally, regex is <em>much</em> slower than by hand lexing,
you have to follow its rules and it's less powerful than doing this by hand. Furthermore, lexing is a great exercise.
In fact, once you understand lexing, you'll understand all language a little more.
Should you lex? I recommend you do if you are writing a language or analysing one. But if you feel like you should lex,
then do it.</p>
<h2 id="important"><a class="header" href="#important">IMPORTANT</a></h2>
<p>I highly recommend you do not directly copy and paste any pieces of code. It will hinder your learning. If you want to change anything,
then do it. Play around with the functions and if you are wondering anything, try it and see.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-lex"><a class="header" href="#how-to-lex">How to lex?</a></h2>
<h3 id="theory"><a class="header" href="#theory">Theory</a></h3>
<p>I'll begin by discussing some theory behind lexing. A lexer is supposed to somehow understand what things are meaningful units
of language, which can seem easy at first, but later seems near impossible. The first thing to discuss is that there is no universal
tokenisation model, as long as it is efficient and generates the desired output, your lexer should be fine.
So, let's try lexing the following:
<code>number += sqrt(16)</code></p>
<p>We want this to become something like</p>
<pre><code class="language-elixir">[
    {&quot;number&quot;, :identifier},
    {&quot;+=&quot;, :assignment},
    {&quot;sqrt&quot;, :identifier},
    {&quot;(&quot;, :oparen},
    {&quot;16&quot;, :number},
    {&quot;)&quot;, :cparen}
]
</code></pre>
<p>This is a <em>list</em> composed of <em>tuples</em>. On the left hand side is the raw unit of meaning, and on the right is its category.
I'll call them the token and tag, respectively. The tag is of the type <code>atom</code> , which you don't need to worry about.
A scanner will work perfectly fine, had they been strings instead. In this case, I just preferred using atoms.</p>
<h3 id="terminology"><a class="header" href="#terminology">Terminology</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Identifier
An identifier is things like a variable or a function name. They are referencing something.</li>
<li>Assignment
An assignment just means that this is an operator that is used to assign a value. An operator is a symbol placed between
identifiers or values to do something.</li>
<li>Oparen
Oparen is short for &quot;opening parentheses.&quot; Parentheses are &quot;(&quot; and &quot;).&quot;</li>
<li>Cparen
Cparen is short for &quot;closing parentheses.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="writing-code"><a class="header" href="#writing-code">Writing code</a></h2>
<p>The next step is to implement the lexer. Because this is a guide using a functional programming language, Elixir, recursion will
be used rather than looping. But don't worry if you're an imperative developer, I actually found it easier to use recursion
for lexing than loops. I'd recommend lexing with a functional programming language if you are using this guide. You can easily
link it to whatever language your main program will use with files.
Recursion, simply, is when a function calls itself. When a function calls itself, it goes back to the start of the function,
much like a <code>continue</code> in a loop.</p>
<p>Elixir requires all functions to be in modules. So that's where we'll begin.</p>
<pre><code class="language-elixir">defmodule Lexer do
    def lex(current  \\ 0, tokenstream  \\ [], len, input_str) do
        char = String.at(input_str, current)
        unless current &gt;= len do
            cond do
                ...
            end
        else
            tokenstream
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>This may not make sense just yet, so I'll explain every line here.
<code>defmodule Lexer do</code> : this defines the &quot;Lexer&quot; module. Be absolutely sure you <strong>name your module in uppercase</strong>,
otherwise everything will break.
<code>def lex(current \\ 0, tokenstream \\ [], len, input_str) do</code> : this line defines the lex function and its parameters.
The <code>\\</code> sets the default arguments for each parameter in Elixir. The <code>current</code> variable is the index on the program
the user inputs, which is <code>input_str</code> . <code>len</code> is the length of <code>input_str</code> .
<code>char = String.at(input_str, current)</code> : this line defines the <code>char</code> variable. This variable is the substring which we are
testing conditions for. <code>String.at(input_str, current)</code> is equivalent to <code>input_str[current]</code> in other language such as
Python.
<code>unless current &gt;= len do</code> : unless <code>current</code> is greater than <code>len</code> , do the following. This is equivalent to <code>if !(current &gt;= len)</code></p>
<p>or <code>if not (current &gt;= len)</code> in other languages. This is crucial because it ensures that recursion only happens when it needs to.
This effectively means if the string has not been exhausted.
<code>cond do</code> : this is a block of code that can have conditions attached to it. This is an equivalent of a block of <code>if</code> s and <code>else if</code> s.
<code>...</code> : this means that we'll fill this section later.</p>
<pre><code class="language-elixir">else
    tokenstream
</code></pre>
<p>This is not a single line. But this is the <code>else</code> block for the <code>unless</code> . This means that this code will execute once the string
has been exhausted. And we return <code>tokenstream</code> . In Elixir, the last expression's return value is what the function will return.
In other words, it's the same as <code>return tokenstream</code> in other languages.
The rest are <code>end</code> s. These terminate blocks. They are equivalent to unindenting in Python or <code>}</code> in a lot of languages.</p>
<h3 id="adding-helper-functions"><a class="header" href="#adding-helper-functions">Adding helper functions</a></h3>
<p>In most programming languages, identifiers are defined using the English alphabet, numbers and <code>_</code> , numbers are written as the
Hindu-Arabic numerals (0, 1, 2, etc.) and strings are written using quotes. Functions are called with parentheses, and so on.
Elixir allows using <code>?</code> in identifiers. And the magic that makes this happen, is of course in part the tokeniser.
To allow you to tweak and debug your lexer easily, as well as be more concise, helper functions are ideal.
So, what is a helper function? In this context, a helper function is a function that takes as input a character and returns a boolean.
It checks for a condition using the character. These are easily the simplest part of the scanner.
I'll start with a few helper functions, and more will be added. Nest these functions in the lexer module.</p>
<pre><code class="language-elixir">def numeric(char) do
    char &gt;= &quot;0&quot; &amp;&amp; char &lt;= &quot;9&quot; # Characters are just organized conveniently. &amp;&amp; means &quot;and.&quot;
    # This function tells us if &quot;char&quot; is a number. It obviously doesn't cover floating point numbers,
    # but you should be able to add them if you need to.
end

def alphanumeric(char) do
    numeric(char) || (char &gt;= &quot;a&quot; &amp;&amp; char &lt;= &quot;z&quot;) || (char &gt;= &quot;A&quot; &amp;&amp; char &lt;= &quot;Z&quot;) || char == &quot;_&quot;
    # This checks if the character is alphabetical, numeric or is equal to &quot;_&quot;.
    # This will be used to create identifier tokens.
    # You can add other conditions to add more characters. But be sure to use a &quot;||&quot; (or).
end

def arithmetic(char) do
    Enum.member?([&quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;%&quot;], char)
    # checks if character is used for arithmetic operations.
    # if it is in that list.
end
</code></pre>
<p>There are explanations on what each of these functions does and how. But these are a foundation for the basic lexical rules
of the language. Be sure to nest these in the <code>Lexer</code> module, so that they're local and accessible by the <code>Lexer.lex</code> function.</p>
<h3 id="simple-symbol-lexing"><a class="header" href="#simple-symbol-lexing">Simple symbol lexing</a></h3>
<p>So now you have the tools to easily identify where each character belongs. You don't need to use these helper functions yet.
But you may have noticed that symbols like &quot;(&quot; or &quot;=&quot; were not covered with the helper functions. These things are oftentimes
single-character tokens, so it's not worth making a function we'll never use or edit.
How do we add the single-character tokens with their tags into the tokenstream? The answer to this is simple: by checking a condition
and performing recursion. What will be done is that when one of these is encountered, <code>lex</code> will be called with new arguments.
Remember the arguments to <code>lex</code> ? They were <code>current</code> , <code>tokenstream</code> , <code>len</code> , <code>input_str</code> . It may not make sense that our lexer
function wants to take its own output as an argument to an imperative programmer. However, it's a crucial part of using recursion
with immutable variables effectively for lexing. What we'll do is call the <code>lex</code> function again when we spot one of these single-
character tokens.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>current</code>: receives<code>current + 1</code>, which is our cursor plus the amount of characters we went over.</li>
<li><code>tokenstream</code>: receives <code>[{char, :TYPE} | tokenstream]</code>. This is prepending (adding as the first element or head of a list)
a tuple containing the character and the category. <code>:TYPE</code> means the tag. If appending is available, I highly recommend
it instead. In Elixir, prepending and then reversing is faster than concatenating lists, so that's what's being done here.</li>
<li><code>len</code>: receives just <code>len</code>.</li>
<li><code>input_str</code>: receives just <code>input_str</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's put this in real Elixir code. Inside our <code>cond</code> block, it should now look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-elixir">                # single-char tokens
                char == &quot;)&quot; -&gt; # if the condition is true, do this.
                    lex(current + 1, [{char, :cparen} | tokenstream], len, input_str)

                char == &quot;(&quot; -&gt; # if the above was false, do this instead. and so on
                    lex(current + 1, [{char, :oparen} | tokenstream], len, input_str)

                char == &quot;{&quot; -&gt;
                    lex(current + 1, [{char, :obrace} | tokenstream], len, input_str)

                char == &quot;}&quot; -&gt;
                    lex(current + 1, [{char, :cbrace} | tokenstream], len, input_str)

                char == &quot;=&quot; -&gt;
                    lex(current + 1, [{char, :assignment} | tokenstream], len, input_str)

                true -&gt; # if all the conditions failed, do this instead.
                        # this is what should happen if an unknown character is found.
                        # Here, it's being ignored. But you can raise an error, if you wish.
                    lex(current + 1, tokenstream, len, input_str)
</code></pre>
<p>If you give your lexer a try now, which you can do by printing <code>Lexer.lex</code> 's output with <code>IO.inspect</code> , it should be able
to scan any of these characters, but ignore everything else.</p>
<h3 id="handling-multiple-character-tokens"><a class="header" href="#handling-multiple-character-tokens">Handling multiple-character tokens</a></h3>
<p>Remember the helper functions you defined a bit ago? Here's where they're going to come in useful. The first step to handling multi-
character tokens is to define some functions to do that for you. This is advantegous in that it increases your code's maintability
significantly in comparison to just doing operations. And it's a lot simpler, too.
The main idea behind handling tokens &gt; 1 character is to go over each character, add it to a temporary string variable
until calling the relevant helper function with the character argument doesn't return true, or the string is exhausted.
Then, that temporary variable is passed into the token stream with a tag. This is a lot easier done than said (not a typo)
but that was my best explanation. Let's start with lexing integers.
Define the following function nested into <code>Lexer</code> .</p>
<pre><code class="language-elixir">    def handlenum(cursor, temp, input_strr) do
        # `cursor' is the same as `current', but to make sure they're distinguished, I use `cursor'
        # `temp' is a temporary variable that begins as an empty string.
        character = String.at(input_strr, cursor)
        if numeric(character) do
            handlenum(cursor + 1, temp &lt;&gt; character, input_strr)
            # if the character in this recursion is numeric, then go back up
            # but go to the next character and add to the temporary variable
        else
            {temp, cursor}
            # return a tuple of the token and the new cursor.
        end
    end
</code></pre>
<p>Closely inspect this, and once you get it, write the rest:</p>
<pre><code class="language-elixir">def handlestring(cursor, temp, input_strr) do
        character = String.at(input_strr, cursor)
        if character != &quot; &quot;&quot; do
            handlestring(cursor + 1, temp &lt;&gt; character, input_strr)
        else
            {temp, cursor}
        end
    end

    def handlealpha(cursor, temp, input_strr) do
        character = String.at(input_strr, cursor)
        if alphanumeric(character) do
            handlealpha(cursor + 1, temp &lt;&gt; character, input_strr)
        else
            {temp, cursor}
        end
    end
</code></pre>
<p>What you will notice, is that the process is quite simple. Each one of these is largely the same as the others, just with
different conditions. In fact, these functions could've been generated with just one function.
But for the sake of simplicity and performance, this will be sufficient.
It's important to note, <strong>if you don't yet understand, don't go to the next part yet.</strong>
It's quite normal and as to be expected that you don't fully understand lexing the first time. So, don't worry and keep trying.</p>
<h3 id="implementing-the-handler-functions"><a class="header" href="#implementing-the-handler-functions">Implementing the handler functions</a></h3>
<p>You should now be able to shove these handler functions that depend on the helper functions into your <code>cond</code> block in <code>Lexer.lex</code> .
Give that a shot and try running your program. It should work if you filled everything in correctly. You should've added something
like the following in your <code>cond</code> block.</p>
<pre><code class="language-elixir">                char == &quot; &quot;&quot; -&gt;
                    {token, cursor} = handlestring(current + 1, &quot;&quot;, input_str)
                    # Increments to manage the quotes. We don't want them.
                    lex(cursor + 1, [{token, :str} | tokenstream], len, input_str)

                numeric(char) -&gt;
                    {token, cursor} = handlenum(current, &quot;&quot;, input_str)
                    lex(cursor, [{token, :number} | tokenstream], len, input_str)

                alphanumeric(char) -&gt;
                    {token, cursor} = handlealpha(current, &quot;&quot;, input_str)
                    lex(cursor, [{token, :identifier} | tokenstream], len, input_str)
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure to add this above the <code>true -&gt;</code> segment.
If we give <code>lex</code> our program, that was intially <code>number += sqrt(16)</code> , the output would be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-elixir">[
    {&quot;number&quot;, :identifier},
    {&quot;+&quot;, :arithmetic},
    {&quot;sqrt&quot;, :identifier},
    {&quot;(&quot;, :oparen},
    {&quot;16&quot;, :number},
    {&quot;)&quot;, :cparen},
]
</code></pre>
<p>This isn't exactly what we want. It ignored <code>=</code> and added an arithmetic out of nowhere. <code>+=</code> should've been <code>{&quot;+=&quot;, :assignment}</code> .
Fortunately, the solution is easy. It will be explained in the next section.</p>
<h3 id="conditional-multi-character-tokens"><a class="header" href="#conditional-multi-character-tokens">Conditional multi-character tokens</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes, you need to lex something that could be one thing or the other, or both. For example, <code>+=</code> should be an <code>:assignment</code></p>
<p>rather than <code>:arithmetic</code> , <code>:assignment</code> . While <code>+ =</code> should be <code>:arithmetic</code> , <code>:assignment</code> . The solution to this is by something
called &quot;peeking.&quot; Peeking is exactly what it sounds like: you look at the next token without actually advancing to the next character.
Knowing that, the idea for scanning <code>+=</code> correctly is simple: when you find a <code>+</code> , peek for an <code>=</code> . If there is, advance twice and
add the token with the tag. Otherwise, add the <code>+</code> alone. So, add this to your <code>cond</code> block.</p>
<pre><code class="language-elixir">                arithmetic(char) -&gt;
                    unless String.at(input_str, current + 1) == &quot;=&quot; do
                        lex(current + 1, [{char, :arithmetic} | tokenstream], len, input_str)
                    else
                        lex(current + 2, [{char &lt;&gt; &quot;=&quot;, :assignment} | tokenstream], len, input_str)
                    end
</code></pre>
<p>But about the <code>=</code> ? Well, do the same thing if you're going to have an <code>==</code> which should be a <code>:comparison</code> . Or, do the same thing as
you did in the start with single-character tokens suh as <code>:oparen</code> .</p>
<h3 id="almost-done"><a class="header" href="#almost-done">Almost done</a></h3>
<p>After that's been done, you're almost done with a basic lexer that you can build on. All you have to do now is go to the <code>else</code> within
<code>Lexer.lex</code> 's <code>unless</code> and replace <code>tokenstream</code> with <code>Enum.reverse(tokenstream)</code> . And that's it. But be sure to read the rest.</p>
<h2 id="notices"><a class="header" href="#notices">Notices</a></h2>
<p>This is an imperfect lexer and has been slightly simplified. Rather than &quot;consuming&quot; the input string, here, we're actually
just indexing it. This is inefficient but it should be sufficient for a lot of cases. Click <a href="https://gist.github.com/VideoCarp/36bca88c6ef61f0a0d993d70ef6df760">here</a> for the finished lexer.

  <summary> Maths </summary>
  You might've heard that you need maths for programming. This is *kinda* true, but also not really.
  You need maths if you do AI or data science. But you don't need maths to make a website.
  There is some mathematical theory in programming, but it's not complex, so don't worry. The maths
  you need for programming depends on the subject, but in general, it's not hard.
</details>
<h2 id="why-program"><a class="header" href="#why-program">Why program?</a></h2>
<p>Why should you program? This is the first important question to ask yourself. Are you interested in programming?
Perhaps you're a student? For work?
Whoever you are, programming is an enriching subject, that once understood, will be a useful or even fun tool to use.
Programming may appear an impossible task, but don't let that affect you. It's just hard to get started.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ℹ️ Some subjects are very difficult in programming, but you'll find a lot are easy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The practical uses of programming:</strong><br />
Programming is applicable in a variety of fields and sometimes you don't even know you're using a program.
Programming is used in engineering, medicine, science, making applications, websites and plenty of others.
In regards to what programming can achieve, the answer is ”anything.”
Any task you can think of, that can happen, can be programmed.
Websites, applications, operating systems and general appliances are or can be programmed.
In short, programming is useful if you need to make something happen.
<strong>Programming as a hobby:</strong><br />
Programming can be a hobby, too.
It can be an eye-popening activity,
that will change your thinking for the better. And help you understand things around you.
It's not easy to describe it.</p>
<h2 id="programming-basics"><a class="header" href="#programming-basics">Programming basics</a></h2>
<p><strong>Thinking programmatically:</strong><br />
The first step to get into programming is to understand how to think about it.
First off, a &quot;program&quot; is a series of instructions to be executed by a computer. This definition has some programming terms. Simply, a &quot;program&quot; is a bunch of code that can be ran by a computer. Sometimes, programs are used
the same as &quot;source files,&quot; which are files that contain code written in a programming language.
So a program is what the computer understands and a source file is what you write. It's not too important to disting
uish these terms at this point, but you can.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ℹ️ Collections of source files or programs that you might use to write a program can be known as &quot;libraries&quot;
or &quot;modules.&quot; Note that &quot;libraries&quot; have a shorthand: &quot;libs.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now you have a basic idea of how files are organised when programming. Another important part of thinking like
a programmer is to consider everything to be ordered instructions you give the computer. You tell the computer
to show &quot;Hello World!&quot; on the screen, it shows that. Think of it as telling the computer to &quot;do this, then do that.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ℹ️ You aren't telling the computer what to do in most cases. You're telling the programming language
you're using to do that for you. If this doesn't make sense, do ignore it.
Learn what's known as &quot;computational thinking&quot; if necessary; it's very useful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Understanding what coding really is:</strong><br />
Coding has a fuzzy definition. But I would define it as creating a representation of what can end up being
a program later. So, things like Scratch still count as code and writing code in files counts too.
When you program, make sure to think of it as that.
<strong>Writing code:</strong><br />
To recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Program: something that the computer can execute, usually generated from a source file</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Source file: a file that is given to a programming language to make a program</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Programming: creating a representation of what can end up being a program.
This won't help you much, yet. So, let's understand how to write code. In general, you'll
find these patterns in most programs.</p>

<p>Arithmetics: they're just maths.
This can look overwhelming. But once you get these, you'll find reading other docs a lot easier. Let's begin with
the simplest: variables. Variables are like pronumerals in maths, only they can be multiple characters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="variables"><a class="header" href="#variables">Variables</a></h2>
<p>A variable is a name for a value. For example, imagine a variable named <code>pi</code> with a value of <code>3.14159</code>.
Now, when you write <code>pi</code>, you get <code>3.14159</code>.
There are 3 basic kinds of variables, and they can be confusing. The most common are mutable variables. For example,
you define a variable named <code>x</code> as <code>5</code>. Then, you change <code>x</code> to <code>2</code>. Of course, because programs execute in order,
all code before you changed <code>x</code> to <code>2</code> will result in <code>5</code>. Unlike maths, variables can be defined in terms of themself.
So, if you had changed <code>x</code> to be <code>x + 1</code>, it would have been <code>5 + 1</code>, which is <code>6</code>. Think of &quot;mutable&quot; as &quot;mutate,&quot;
which means change.<br />
The other kinds, immutable and constant variables can't change. They're not the same, but I won't confuse you.</p>
<h2 id="references"><a class="header" href="#references">References</a></h2>
<p>References are simply when you write a name for something, like an identifier or a function.
Not much else to say.</p>
<h2 id="functions-1"><a class="header" href="#functions-1">Functions</a></h2>
<p>Functions are used to name and reuse bits of code you have written. For example, imagine a program that adds
<code>5</code> and <code>2</code> and outputs it, but you want that to happen many times, not just once. In this case, one solution
would be to use a function. You'd name your function whatever you want, with parameters and a body.
Parameters are <em>variables</em> that can take <em>arguments</em> from the programmer calling the function. Arguments
are just any value that will make sense in the function's body, at the simplest level. The function's body
is the code inside it.</p>
<p>For example, imagine a function named <code>add1</code> with the parameter <code>num</code> and the body
<code>return num + 1</code>. If you call <code>add1</code> with <code>1</code> as the argument for the parameter <code>num</code>, then you'll get
<code>2</code>. <code>return</code> usually means what the function should result in.
This is kind of similar to functions in mathematics, for example <code>f(x) = x + 1</code>.</p>
<h2 id="control-flow"><a class="header" href="#control-flow">Control Flow</a></h2>
<p>I want something to happen only if a certain condition is met. How do I do that? By using what is called an <code>if</code>
statement. An <code>if</code> statement is composed of a condition and a body. A condition is exactly what it sounds like.
For example, an <code>if</code> statement with the condition that <code>pi &gt; 3</code> and a body that outputs &quot;Pi is greater than 3&quot;
would run, only if <code>pi</code> is greater than 3. <code>if</code> statements can be accompanied with <code>else</code> and <code>else if</code> bodies.
<code>else</code> only happens if all conditions fail, and <code>else if</code>s only happens if all conditions above it fail.</p>
<p>What about if I want something to only happen while a condition is met? That's why the <code>while</code> keyword exists,
and it's pretty much the same as <code>if</code> in terms of use.</p>
<p>What if I want something to happen a set number of times? Here, you can use a <code>for</code> loop. The way they're used is
different in different programming languages, but generally, there is what's known as a control variable and the
number of iterations. A control variable is a variable that changes every time the body of the <code>for</code> loop is repeated
that you can access. Iterations are the repetitions of the body of the <code>for</code> loop.</p>
<p>Collectively, these are called control flow.</p>
<h2 id="types"><a class="header" href="#types">Types</a></h2>
<p>Types are something you will hear a lot about in programming.</p>
<ul>
<li>Strings: text</li>
<li>Integers: whole numbers, negative or not</li>
<li>Floating-point numbers: numbers with a decimal place</li>
<li>Lists and arrays: multiple same-type values that can be referenced using one name</li>
<li>Tuples: multiple values that can be referenced using one name
There's also &quot;typing,&quot; which doesn't refer to writing in a computer, but how types are default with.</li>
<li>Dynamic typing: a variable's value can change type, and a function's parameters' values as well as its
resulting (return) value can change type.</li>
<li>Static typing: a variable's value cannot change type, a function's types cannot change</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="different-ways-to-program"><a class="header" href="#different-ways-to-program">Different ways to program</a></h2>
<p>In programming terminology (the terms used), different ways to program are known as paradigms.
The most intuitive in my opinion is procedural, imperative programming, which is what you have probably been using.</p>
<ul>
<li>Imperative: concerned with the &quot;how&quot; of the program</li>
<li>Procedural: oriented towards programming-style functions. It is a sub-paradigm of imperative.
There's also object-oriented programming, which is quite common too.</li>
<li>Object-oriented programming: oriented towards &quot;objects.&quot; It is a sub-paradigm of imperative.
And there are declarative programming sub-paradigms, such as functional and markup.</li>
<li>Declarative: concerned with the &quot;what&quot; of the program.</li>
<li>Functional: oriented towards mathematical-style functions and immutable variables. It is a sub-paradigm of declarative.</li>
<li>Markup: used to show meaningful imagery.</li>
</ul>
<p>This book mainly focuses on imperative programming, and I suggest you stick to it for now.
It's not in the scope of this book to discuss at length programming paradigms, but if any interest you at some point,
then do search them up. I'll discuss a little more in the &quot;Picking a programming language&quot; chapter.</p>
<h2 id="the-art-of-googling"><a class="header" href="#the-art-of-googling">The Art of Googling</a></h2>
<p>What really is googling? To keep Google happy, I define googling as the use of the Google search engine to get
information on any subject. And programmers google a lot more than you'd think. In fact, googling is the most
important skill for a programmer to have. You google to learn a new programming language, a new library, to figure
out what's wrong with your code, to find help and so much more. So, how do you google effectively? Googling is a skill
that can be cultivated over years of experience. But the good news is, because you aren't <em>yet</em> a skilled googler,
you can boost your skill quickly.</p>
<p>How do you do that? By using the google search modifiers syntax. They might have their own name,
but I'll just use this. &quot;Syntax&quot; simply means the way something is written. Collectively,
English's syntax is composed of its grammar, punctuation, vocabulary, etc.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VideoCarp/website/gh-pages/readables/CCE0F897-D8EE-4D65-B998-77F5E14CEDBE.jpeg" alt="Google's search refinement techniques" />
I got this image straight from <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en">Google</a>, and you can
see them there if you'd like. This image does not show all search modifiers, but I doubt you're going to be
looking at social media for answers to your programming problems, save for Reddit. Do you ever find that when you're
searching for something, you keep getting unrelated results? Or perhaps Google ignores some of your search query?</p>
<p>Both these are problems I frequently encounter while searching. But the solution's easy. If you don't want Google
to ignore some words in your search query, wrap it in quotes, like this <code>&quot;GitHub pages&quot;</code>. This will only return results
that have the text &quot;GitHub pages&quot; exactly; the word GitHub has to follow the word pages. If you just want results
that contain both, then use the search query <code>&quot;GitHub&quot; &quot;Pages&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>Let's say you keep searching for stack exchange,
i.e.: exchanging a stack. This is a model for search queries you're likely to make if you forget some terms. You'll
keep getting results from StackExchange, the website and other websites that talk about it. So, now you try
<code>exchanging a stack</code>. Alas, that changes nothing. A good idea here is to eliminate results containing &quot;StackExchange.&quot;
So, to your new search query, add <code>-stackexchange</code>. And now, you've found your result: swapping stacks.</p>
<p>Googling is tough. But here's a short, simple list on when you should use certain search modifiers and techniques.</p>
<ul>
<li>Quotes: when you have an error. Be careful not to include the part where it says where the error happened
in your code, though.</li>
<li>Minus: When you keep getting a result you don't want.</li>
<li><code>site:foo.bar</code>: when you want to find an answer to a question that you lost.</li>
<li><code>before:date</code> and <code>after:date</code>: when the results you get are useless because they're too new or too old.
<strong>What websites to look for:</strong><br />
It depends on the programming language you're using. But for most programming languages, try to find StackOverflow
answers, GitHub projects or issues, and really any website you find.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="picking-a-programming-language"><a class="header" href="#picking-a-programming-language">Picking a programming language</a></h2>
<p>This is a hole a lot of emerging programmers fall into, they just can't pick which language to get started. Well,
I'm here to help with that. Picking a language is hard, because there are so many options. &quot;I wanna do JavaScript,
so I can do web development, but I don't like the language.&quot; Or &quot;I wanna do Python because it has great libraries,
but I don't like it.&quot;
Lots and lots of things like that.</p>
<p>The real answer is, it honestly doesn't matter what your first language is.
I tried starting with JavaScript, but I found it too confusing and ended up starting with Python. To this day,
Python is the language I know most. But learning it was really difficult. At some point, I decided why don't I also
learn other programming languages? So I tried. It was hard, but a lot easier. And now, I found learning Haskell,
regarded as a difficult programming language, quite easy.</p>
<p>What I mean to say here, is you should start with whatever programming language you lean towards, even if you have
doubts about it.<br />
<strong>My controversial opinions:</strong><br />
I have some rather controversial opinions about which programming language to start with. This is the nature
of anyone helping others pick a language to start with. I recommend beginning with a simple programming language,
like Python, Lua, or Ruby. Start with a dynamically typed programming language, because types are a difficult
concept.</p>
<p>Don't start with something like C#, Java or C++. C# and Java require you to understand object-oriented
programming, which is a difficult concept for beginners and is highly controversial in the programming community.
And they're both just simply hard. C++ is <em>very</em> difficult in comparison to other languages, too. My advice
would be to start with a simple language, like one of the three I listed, and then if you want to, work your way
to more difficult languages.</p>
<p>In truth, you don't always need to use difficult programming languages. You might hear that Python and Ruby are slow.
And that's absolutely true. They are slow. But in most cases, it doesn't matter. Your user likely won't care.
And Lua's really fast with LuaJIT, although Lua is not very popular. There are plenty of fast, simple programming
languages, like Go, Julia and more. But unless you like their syntax, I'd begin with the simplest language
I can find.</p>
<p>Obviously, this doesn't mean begin with HTML &amp; CSS, because they're markup languages and likely
won' help you understand others. Not to mention they're pretty frustrating compared to other code.</p>
<h5 id="picking-a-paradigm"><a class="header" href="#picking-a-paradigm">Picking a paradigm</a></h5>
<p>Another hole programmers often fall into is choosing a paradigm. My advice is to do what you like. Do
procedural programming if you like it, do object-oriented programming if you like it. But I'll try to give
an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of some of the most popular paradigms.</p>
<p><strong>Procedural:</strong><br />
Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intuitive and simple</li>
<li>Widely supported<br />
Disadvantages:</li>
<li>Rare for some fields, like GUI.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Object-oriented:</strong>
Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Used for GUI</li>
<li>Good for making libraries</li>
<li>Popular<br />
Disadvantages:</li>
<li>Complex</li>
<li>Clutters code (verbose)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Functional:</strong><br />
Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very easy to debug</li>
<li>Concise<br />
Disadvantages:</li>
<li>Complex to get started.</li>
<li>Less widely supported.<br />
A lot of people will disagree with me here. I ignored any advantage or disadvantage that pops up in all 3.
My advice would be to begin with procedural. It's really the simplest. Then you can dive into one of the other
paradigms once you're experienced enough.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In summary: pick what you like and don't worry about it.</strong></p>
<h2 id="fields-to-program-in"><a class="header" href="#fields-to-program-in">Fields to program in</a></h2>
<p>I'll just list a few popular programming topics.</p>
<ul>
<li>App development: GUI (generally object-oriented, but you <em>can</em> use other paradigms).</li>
<li>Web development: Frontend (what the user sees) and backend (managing the server and taking requests from the frontend)</li>
<li>Algorithms and data structures: I really can't explain it, so search it up.</li>
<li>Parsing: breaking down language into meaningful units (I have a guide on this in my website).</li>
<li>Concurrency: dealing with multiple programs running at the same time.<br />
and many more. It again depends on the language.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="gui-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#gui-in-rust">GUI in Rust</a></h1>
<p>The Rust programming language seems like a good fit for GUI programming. C++ developers have access to Qt, wxWidgets and many
more. It's considered that GUI is just not there yet in Rust. I tried using Iced, it seemed like a good option.
But Iced's examples were not working. I didn't bother with other libraries, they were mostly GTK and webview.
I gave it another try.
And at least two options <em>did</em> work!
<strong>egui and Tauri</strong>. You've probably heard of both of them.</p>
<h2 id="tauri"><a class="header" href="#tauri">Tauri</a></h2>
<p>You might criticize Tauri for its performance. But you'd be wrong.
Tauri is nowhere near as bloated as Electron and it allows you to use a Rust backend. You can call Rust from the frontend.
One problem might be that Tauri requires you to use web technologies, such as HTML, CSS and JS.
However, you kind of have other options. It's possible to use Fable with F#, ClojureScript or Go with GopherJS.
There're also Pyscript and Brython for Python, which are extremely easy to set up.
The problem here is that you don't get to use Rust for everything. If you're afraid of CSS and not JavaScript, check out SASS.
And some frameworks you can use with to-js compilers might allow you to skip HTML.</p>
<h2 id="egui"><a class="header" href="#egui">egui</a></h2>
<p>egui is a popular GUI crate for Rust. Contrary to Tauri, you <em>can</em> just use Rust. egui is in &quot;immediate mode&quot; style.
This can be more concise and easier to reason about than you might think. In egui, something like this is possible.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>ui.label(&amp;mut self.labelcontent); // you define this.
if ui.add(Button::new(&quot;Click me!&quot;)).clicked() {
    self.labelcount = &quot;You have clicked the button!&quot;;
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>As you can see, you can connect things concisely. This label is bound to <code>self.labelcontent</code>. When <code>self.labelcontent</code> changes,
it will in the next frame. So it updates in what appears instantly.
I found egui to be quite intuitive and I haven't yet found any problems with it. The only problems with egui that I know of
are that it is not native (but it still looks great) and that updates have breaking changes.</p>
<h2 id="other-options"><a class="header" href="#other-options">Other options?</a></h2>
<p>I've only tried Iced, other than these. Unfortunately, examples didn't work. Soon, this may be fixed.
But for now, I suggest you try these out. If you aren't satisfied, perhaps look at <a href="https://docs.rs">docs.rs</a> and search
for GUI there. Also check out <a href="https://areweguiyet.com/">areweguiyet</a>.
You can also bind libraries from other languages. I strongly suggest giving many libraries a try until one of them works
for you.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="functional-piping-and-composition"><a class="header" href="#functional-piping-and-composition">Functional piping and composition</a></h1>
<p>If you've been trying to get into functional programming, there's a good chance you've heard of composition and piping.
These concepts apply to point-free programming. This is an attempt at a simple, clear explanation of function composition
and piping. I will write these examples in F#, but the concepts apply to other languages like Haskell. They just use
different operators sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: basic programming knowledge. This explanation is going to be simple.</p>
<p><strong>Piping</strong><br />
Let's begin with the simpler of the two (at least according to my experience): piping. There are two ways which you could
pipe a value to a function. Forwards, and backwards. When you pipe forward, you are applying the left side of the forward
pipe to the leftmost argument of the right side of the pipe.
In F#, piping forward is done with the <code>|&gt;</code> operator.
This means that</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">&quot;Hello World!&quot; |&gt; printfn &quot;%s&quot;
// is the same as
printfn &quot;%s&quot; &quot;Hello World!&quot;
// Another example would be
let add1 x = x + 1
5 |&gt; add1
// is the same as
add1 5
// And
let add x y = x + y
5 |&gt; (1 |&gt; add) // 6
// Parentheses are used to clarify precende (order)
</code></pre>
<p>It simply applies the something to the first <em>unfilled</em> argument (if you read from left to right).
In Haskell, the operator used for this is <code>&amp;</code>.
Piping backwards may be clear to you now. It's the same thing, but it's read from right to left.
In F#, backward pipes are done with the <code>&lt;|</code> operator.
For example,</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let subtract x y = x - y
subtract &lt;| 5 &lt;| 1 // 4
subtract 5 1 // 4
</code></pre>
<p>In Haskell, this is done with <code>$</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Composition</strong><br />
Function composition is a <em>lot</em> simpler than it may seem. It's the creation of a function that applies a function to
the result of another. In F#, composition is done with <code>&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;&lt;</code>. Like piping, <code>&gt;&gt;</code> is read left to right and <code>&lt;&lt;</code> is read
right to left.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let add1 x = x + 1
let multiplyBy5 x = x * 5
let addThenMultiply x = (add1 &gt;&gt; multiplyBy5) x
printfn &quot;%d&quot; (addThenMultiply 4) // 25
printfn &quot;%d&quot; (multiplyBy5 (add1 4)) // 25
</code></pre>
<p>In Haskell, <code>.</code> is used for function composition.</p>
<p><strong>Why bother?</strong><br />
A fair question you might have is, why bother piping and composing functions? Well, piping and composition helps us
clear up our code of explicit rules for parentheses. Consider the example for composition. The first one is easier to read.
And if we reuse it, we save on writing extra code. It makes things easier. And what about piping? Piping has the same applications.
Would you prefer <code>Seq.toList numbers |&gt; Seq.iter (printfn &quot;%d&quot;)</code> or <code>Seq.iter (printfn &quot;%d&quot; (Seq.toList numbers))</code>?
Maybe you'd prefer the latter. But it's more idiomatic to use composition and piping sometimes.
And sometimes, there's a function with a long list of arguments you need to supply, with long names.
Would you prefer</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">AVeryLongFunction VeryLongArgument1 VeryLongArgument2 (x VeryLongArgument3AppliedToX) (VeryLongFunctionName VeryLongArgument4AppliedToVeryLongFunctionApplied)
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">VeryLongArgument1
|&gt; VeryLongArgument2
|&gt; (X VeryLongArgument3AppliedToX)
|&gt; (VeryLongFunctionName VeryLongArgument4AppliedToVeryLongFunctionName)
|&gt; AVeryLongFunction
</code></pre>
<p>There are cases where this does happen. Just look at some examples using Avalonia.FuncUI.
There, we are saved by the piping operators.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="reviewing-functional-programming"><a class="header" href="#reviewing-functional-programming">Reviewing functional programming</a></h1>
<p>Here, I'll cover review functional programming according to my experience when I tried it. I'll cover what advantages there are
and what disadvantages there are. My struggles, and what I found easier, and finally a conclusion. This is not a scientific
paper, and is based solely on developer experience, it's more useful if you're trying to understand developer experience.
Hopefully, this will help you decide whether or not to try functional programming.<br />
So, I originally started programming in general procedurally, with Python. It's important to note that functional programming
and object oriented programming are not the only two paradigms -- contrary to popular belief.
Procedural programming is largely very different to functional programming, so do keep that in mind.</p>
<p>When I started functional programming, I started with F#. I was careful to avoid imperative structures like control flow. And when I began, it was
obviously quite difficult, but I felt the same way as when I started programming in general. It changed my thinking.
And it will most likely change yours. If the well of programming seems dry to you, functional programming can be like rain.</p>
<p>Initially, functional programming was significantly harder to me than imperative programming, because I honestly didn't
understand functional programming and my mind hadn't yet adapted. I found it difficult to deal with there being no variables
-- there are immutables, but I find using 'variable' misleading when they cannot be varied. And it seemed impossible to iterate
when I shouldn't use loops.</p>
<p>After some practice, I caught the idea of using recursion to repeat and the parameters of a function as control
&quot;variables.&quot; Things started becoming a lot clearer, and immutability wasn't so much a burden anymore. It felt different to
writing imperative code... but what's the point?</p>
<p>I decided to write a lexer -- not important for you to understand -- functionally, because I had always used them to learn
new programming languages. This task was always hard for me to do, until I tried doing it functionally.</p>
<p>I explored other functional programming languages like Haskell, and Haskell was a lot easier than most people call it out
to be. And I explored the Lisp language family. I didn't have any practical uses for these, but they were still nice.</p>
<p>It also filled a lot of gaps I had when doing imperative programming. A lot of imperative or multi-paradigm languages,
like Rust, Python or CoffeeScript had functional features I didn't know about, that were quite useful. It helped me
understand <code>None</code> and <code>Some</code>, <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, some tasks <em>were</em> harder in functional programming, like using a hashmap or dictionary to keep track of things.
And I had a concern: the memory cost of recursion. But this was <em>never</em> a limitation. The CPU usage was lower, though
and you might chalk this up to language, but in most benchmarks, functional programming can be slightly slower, but use
significantly less of the CPU.</p>

<p>Yes, you should. Unless you have time constraints, functional programming can be enlightening. And it's not like you <em>have</em>
to use it. You can learn the philosophy, at the very least.
I'm not here to claim it's superior or inferior to <em>use</em>, I'm here to voice my opinion on whether it's worth a try.</p>
