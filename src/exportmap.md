it is the correct world. Now that you have the exact folder, and the correct apps you need for your map, follow this process: 

- Compress the **_contents_** of the folder.
  Zip the contents of the folder, not the folder itself, otherwise your .mcworld will fail to import.
- Rename to `your_map's_name`

- Change the zip file's extension to `.mcworld`
  You've got your compressed folder now set up. Try testing it!
