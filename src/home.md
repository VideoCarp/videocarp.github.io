## Using this

On the top-left, there is a Menu bar that looks like 3 lines.
This allows you to navigate to the different sections of the website.
Near it, there is also a paintbrush icon. Use this to change the theme of the website.
There's also a search bar. Use it to search the website.
On the right, there is a file icon. Use this to print the website.
You can also press the arrows to go back and forward in pages. But this is not recommended.
This is because this is not exactly a book. It's more of a website.
